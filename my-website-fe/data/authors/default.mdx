### Hello...
The content you will find here mostly consists of notes that I have taken for myself.
Without adhering to a specific category, I mainly share reviews of the books I've read, my experiences in the field of software, and occasionally writings on various other topics.
I hope you find the content here as interesting and useful as I do.
